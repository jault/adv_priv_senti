# Adversarial Privacy Preservation for Speech Sentiment Recognition

Various automated services may be improved by under-
standing the psychological state their users are in. Spotify, a
music streaming service, for example, could suggest music
matching the listeners’ mood. Smart-devices are increas-
ingly being installed in homes and their services could ben-
efit from the emotion recognition of the occupants. How-
ever, this benefit may require data to be transmitted for pro-
cessing externally. This creates a concern around privacy-
preservation. Consumers are reluctant to purchase devices
in which personal information is exposed, particularly in the
form of visual or audio data. They worry that private con-
versations may be stored and shared without their explicit
permission.

In this project, we extended prior work on privacy-
preservation using adversarial training of deep artificial
neural networks (Wu, Wang, 2018)  to the domain of emotion recognition
from audio and visual inputs. We showed that subject iden-
tity attributes can be largely eliminated while maintaining
emotion classification performance.
